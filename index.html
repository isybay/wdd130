        <p>
            Hello there! My name is Israel Ayodamola Bayode, but you can simply call me Israel or Izybay which is a contraction of my first name, Israel, and my last name, Bayode.
            I am a student of Brigham Young University-Idaho, studying Web Design and Development. I am currently in my third semester and I am loving every bit of it.
            I enjoy spending time on the internet, learning new things and watching documentaries. I also enjoy playing video games and watching recommended movies.

        <p>
            I currently live in Suwon-si, South Korea. It is a beautiful city with a lot of history and culture. I have been living here for over 3 years and I have enjoyed every bit of it.
            The food is amazing and the people are very friendly. I have also been able to learn the language and I can communicate, to just some extent, in Korean.
